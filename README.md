Overview
This guide explains how to increase the BOOT partition size from 32MB to 96MB. This is often necessary for installing large custom recoveries or other modifications.
> [!WARNING]
> IMPORTANT: Before you begin, ensure you have a complete backup of all important data. Incorrectly following these instructions can lead to a bricked device or data loss. Proceed at your own risk.
> 
Prerequisites
 * You must already have a custom recovery (TWRP or OrangeFox) installed.
 * You must know how to use SP Flash Tool to recover your phone in case of a hard brick. This guide will not save you if you don't have a full backup and knowledge of SP Flash Tool.
 * You must have an external SD card.

  Step 1: Download the Archive
 * Download the correct archive for your firmware version (see the Downloads section below).
 * Save the archive to a convenient location on your external SD card.
> [!NOTE]
> An external SD card is mandatory. The partition backup and logs will not be saved without it.
> 

Step 2: Boot into TWRP Recovery
 * Turn off your phone completely.
 * Boot into TWRP Recovery (usually by holding Power + Volume Up).

Step 3: Flash the Archive
 * In TWRP, tap "Install."
 * Navigate to your external SD card and find the downloaded archive.
 * Select the archive and "Swipe to confirm Flash."
 * Wait for the flashing process to complete.

Step 4: Reboot System
 * After the flash is successful, go back to the main menu.
 * Select "Reboot," then "System."

Step 5: Verify the Result
After your device reboots, you can verify that the BOOT partition size has increased. You can check this using a terminal app (like Termux) or by booting back into recovery and checking the partition info.

The re-partitioning script automatically creates a backup of your original partition table. Use this to restore your device if needed.

  Step 1: Locate the Backup Archive
 * The backup ZIP file is automatically saved to your external SD card by the script.
 * The filename will be in the following format:
   /external_sd/gpt_partition_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip

 * Example: gpt_partition_backup_20251115_162600.zip
 * Ensure your SD card is inserted and accessible in Recovery.

Step 2: Boot into Recovery
 * Turn off your device.
 * Boot into your custom recovery (e.g., TWRP or OrangeFox).

Step 3: Flash the Restore Archive
 * In the recovery main menu, choose "Install."
 * Navigate to your external SD card and select your gpt_partition_backup_*.zip file.
 * Swipe to confirm the flash.

Step 4: Restoration Process
The backup script will perform the following critical operations:
 * Restore the original GPT partition table.
 * Restore the original boot partition.
 * Display the message: "Recovery complete" when finished.
Step 5: Finish
 * Once the flash is complete, select "Reboot System."
 * Your device should now boot with its original partition layout.

If Something Goes Wrong
If the archive fails to flash or your device doesn't boot after the process:
 * Please provide the log file generated by TWRP (or the script itself, which may be found on the SD card).
 * If possible, capture and provide an ADB log.
Command to get an ADB log:
adb logcat > log.txt
